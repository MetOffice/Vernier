vernier_mod.F90
---------------

.. Note: Breathe spits out a whole host of issues when trying to include this
   file because of all the Fortran syntax. It's mostly just warnings but there
   doesn't seem to be a way of turning them off so they cause the workflow to
   fail.
Coming soon, but for now, this file can be found on the Vernier GitHub: https://github.com/MetOffice/Vernier/blob/main/src/f/vernier_mod.F90
